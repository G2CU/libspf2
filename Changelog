	* More docuementation on the API

	* Example programs for the API are available in bin/spf_example

	* The code has been cleaned up enough so that it now compiles
	  cleanly with the gcc options "-W -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes
	  -Wwrite-strings".  On many systems it also compiles cleanly with
	  -ansi/-std=c89/-std=c99, but there are too many problems with
	  include file incompatibilities to distribute that way.

	* Support has been added for direction errors/warnings/debug
	  output to syslog instead of stderr/stdout.

	* Support for SPF_result_2mx()

	* thread safe (res_ninit/res_nquery)

	* configure --with-bind=dir

	* support for SPF_result_hello

	* support for NetBSD with bind4/8
	
	* API cleanup in preparation for v1.0

	* IPv6 fixes

	* DoS limits on PTR/MX lookups

	* quite a bit of documentation has been added to the public
	  include files.
	
	* SPF_lint()  (new) We now give warnings about questionable constructs

	* SPF_set_exp() now has an API that matches SPF_set_local_policy()

	* SPF_compile() CIDR notations now conform to the SPF spec (/ip4//ip6)

	* SPF_set_ip_str() (new)  auto-detects IPv4 vs IPv6 addresses

	* SPF_set_ipv[46]_str()   now resets client_dom

	* SPF_set_envelope_from()  now resets helo_dom

	* IPv6 now supported, but not really tested very much

	* DNS layers don't constantly malloc/free structures.

	* SPF_dns_cache layer is much more functional:
	  * supports more than 64k DNS RRs (CRC-32 vs CRC-16)
	  * reclaim list
	  * hit/miss stats
	  * minimum TTL values

	* SPF_dns_zone (new) create a static zone file on the fly

	* SPF_dsn_test now is just a wrapper around SPF_dns_zone()

	* SPF_dns_null now gives better debugging output

	* SPF_dns_resolve now handles TXT RR w/ substrings

	* new macro var: %{c}  pretty-prints client_ip  (only different
		for IPv6)

	* SPF_results()  now more closely matches M:S:Q and generally
		gives better error messages.

	* SPF_get_spf()  Now checks for multiple "v=spf1" RR in the same
		domain.  (an error)

	* New test system:  Bigger, better, and much more flexible
	
	* Lots of little bug fixes found during the heavy testing.  Most
		of the bugs were corner cases that would take more words to
		describe than were required to fix them.

	* converted to use autoconf
	
	* rearanged source into a tree instead of having everthing in one
	directory
	
	* bug fix:  huge cidr lengths, such as a/99999999999999 now return
	an error instead of silently returning a valid (but probably not
	useful) value.

	* No previous versions have been released, so everything has changed
