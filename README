 * @par Original README from Wayne Schlitt

Libspf2 is an implementation of the SPF specification as found at
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mengwong-spf-00.txt
or doc/draft-mengwong-spf-00.txt

Libspf2 is in beta testing and should only be used in production
systems with caution.  It has not been widely compiled and tested on
machines with different operating systems, CPU architectures, or
network configurations.  It has not been audited for security errors.

While libspf2 is beta code, a lot of effort has been put into
making it secure by design, and a great deal of effort has been put
into the regression tests.  Functions such as sprintf() are never
used, things like snprintf() are used instead.  There are few fixed
sized buffers/arrays, instead, most data structures are dynamically
allocated with the allocation sized recorded so I can check to make
sure the buffer isn't overflowed.  The return values from malloc() and
other system calls are checked and handled as gracefully as I can.
The valgrind program is regularly run to make sure that there are no
memory leaks and reads/writes to invalid memory.


This code has been compiled and passed its regression tests on Debian
Linux (sid/testing) on the x86, FreeBSD 4.3 (x86), FreeBSD 4.9
(x86??), NetBSD 1.62 (x86?), SunOS 5.8 on the ultrasparc, and a few
others.  It uses the autotools (autoconfig, libtools, automake, etc.)
to try and make things more portable, so it will likely work on other
systems also.
